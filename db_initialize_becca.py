'''Project 5 integrates Python and SQL, focusing on database interactions using SQLite. 
This project introduces logging, a useful tool for debugging and monitoring projects, and 
involves creating and managing a database, building a schema, and performing various SQL operations,
including queries with joins, filters, and aggregations.
